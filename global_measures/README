There are 3 brain measures: volume, area, thickness
There are 3 groups: K, SZ, BP
All models are run with and without their corresponding global variable: BrainTotalVol, total_area, mean_thickness


```freesurfer_analysis_lateral.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Brain region measure ~ group*sex + age + site + eulernumber + (global brain measure)

for each cortical brain region with and without a correpsonding global brain measure. Separate models are also run on data from each of the sex independently.


```freesurfer_analysis_lateral_subcortical.R``` runs the same type of model for subcortical brain regions.


```freesurfer_analysis_lateral_plot.R``` plots the data generated by ```freesurfer_analysis_lateral.R```. Plots the effect sizes on ggseg3d based brains. Also plots LSmeans estimates and the p-value lineplots, but not mapped onto a brain figure.


```make_brain_region_table.py``` is a script to combine post-hoc contrasts statistical tests and effect sizes. The script generates an excel sheet for each specific combination of the sex (female or male), measure (volume, area, thickness), contrast (BP-K, SZ-K) and model (with or without) the correpsonding global covariates. But also combines all of this into one file. 



The rest of the scripts are used to plot boundaries on the effect size brain maps from ```freesurfer_analysis_lateral_plot.R```. 

```plot_ref_brains.R``` makes a plot of each brain region in black in the ggseg3d map, while all other regions is white.

```find_boundaries.py``` finds the png image coordinates that separates the brain regions.

```plot_brains.py``` uses the png image coordinates to drawn boundaries on the brain plots from ```freesurfer_analysis_lateral_plot.R```.
