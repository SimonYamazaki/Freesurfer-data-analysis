There are 4 behavioral measures: CBCL_ext, CBCL_int, CBCL_totsc and CGAS
There are 5 global brain measures: BrainTotalVol, CortexVol, total_area, mean_thickness, eICV_samseg
There are 3 groups: K, SZ, BP
All models are run with and without the global variable: eICV_samseg

Model reduction steps is shown in the generated excel files. If interaction effects is insignificant, a model without the interaction term, however, with the main effect terms kept in the model is analyzed.



```global_behavioural_analysis_A.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Global brain measure ~ behavioral measure + age + sex + site + eulernumber 



```global_behavioural_analysis_B.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Global brain measure ~ behavioral measure + group*sex + age + site + eulernumber 



```global_behavioural_analysis_C.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Global brain measure ~ group*behavioral measure + group*sex + age + site + eulernumber 



```global_behavioural_analysis_single_groups.R``` runs with a model on the form (but only on data from a particular group):

Global brain measure ~ behavioral measure + age + sex + site + eulernumber 


```behav_response_whole_groups.R``` and ```behav_response_single_groups.R``` run models with the behavioral measure as the response variable on the form:

behavioral measure ~ group*sex + age + site + eulerNumber
