There are 5 global brain measures: BrainTotalVol, CortexVol, total_area, mean_thickness, eICV_samseg
There are 3 groups: K, SZ, BP
All models are run with and without the global variable: eICV_samseg


```global_measures_generalized.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Global brain measure ~ group*sex + age + sex + site + eulernumber 



```global_measures_height.R``` runs with a model on the form:

Global brain measure ~ group*sex + age + site + eulernumber + height



```global_measures_plots.R``` plots the data generated by the two other scripts above. Plots are LSmeans estimates and the p-values.



Separate models are also run on data from each of the sex independently-
